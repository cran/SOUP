Description: Construct a ranking of a set of treatments/groups by
    gathering together information coming from several response variables.
    It can be used with both balanced and unbalanced experiments
    (with almost all test statistics) as well as in presence of either
    continuous covariates or a stratifying (categorical) variable.
